    <string name="app_description">This app demonstrates a way to retrieve the user\'s current location (or location history) without asking for location permission.\n\nIt does this by asking the user to take a photo using their system camera app (without asking for a camera permission either) and extracting the EXIF data from it.\n\nIt can also retrieve the location history of the user by asking the user to give the app access to their camera roll (using the read external storage permission) and reading the location data of all their photos.\n\nThis is an open source app and can be found at:\nhttp://github.com/savvasdalkitsis/betwixt</string>
